        <h2>1) What is Java?</h2>
        <p>Java is the high-level, object-oriented,
            robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, high performance,<br>  Multithreaded, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling
            in June 1991.<br>  It can also be known as the platform as it provides its own JRE and API.</p>
        <h2>2) What do you understand by Java virtual machine?</h2>
        <p>Java Virtual Machine<br>
            is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the Java program.<br>
            JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in the Java code.<br>
            JVM is the specification which must be implemented in the computer system.<br>
            The Java code is compiled by JVM to be a Bytecode which is machine independent and close to the native code.</p>    
        <h2>3) What are the various access specifiers in Java?</h2>
        <p>In Java, access specifiers are the keywords which are used to define the access scope of the method,<br>
           class, or a variable. In Java, there are four access specifiers given below.</p>
           <li><b>Public</b> The classes, methods, or variables which are defined as public, can be accessed by any class or method.</li>
           <li><b>Protected</b> Protected can be accessed by the class of the same package, or by the sub-class of this class, or within the same class.</li>
           <li><b>Default</b> Default are accessible within the package only. By default, all the classes, methods, and variables are of default scope.</li>
           <li><b>Private</b> The private class, methods, or variables defined as private can be accessed within the class only.</li>
        <h2>4) What is the output of the following Java program?</h2>

        <p>The output of the above code will be</p>

        <h2>5) What are the advantages of Packages in Java?</h2>
        <p>There are various advantages of defining packages in Java.</p> 
        <li>Packages avoid the name clashes.</li>
        <li>The Package provides easier access control.</li>
        <li>We can also have the hidden classes that are not visible outside and used by the package.</li>
        <li>It is easier to locate the related classes.</li><br>
